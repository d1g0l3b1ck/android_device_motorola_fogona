Touchscreen doesn't work. Use a USB-OTG to plug in your favorite mouse.

Neither ADB nor MTP works.

Some fstab entries are broken still.

Encryption doesn't work, thus by extension installing zips are broken as well.



That being said, regular backups without data seem to be working, although I haven't tried to restore yet.

Anyone who wants to finish this, please, help yourself. I do not have time to finish this and won't anytime soon. Thank you!
