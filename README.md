Touchscreen doesn't work. Use a USB-OTG to plug in your favorite mouse.

Neither ADB nor MTP works.

Encryption doesn't work.

Some fstab entries are broken still.


That being said, regular backups without data seem to be working, although I haven't tried to restore yet.

Please, anyone who wants to finish this please, help yourself. I do not have time to finish this and won't anytime soon. Thank you!
